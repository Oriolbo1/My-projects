The main file is the "API", once the program is running in our CMD, it allows for externall calls to be made. 
The secondary file "Machine_learning" is a program that would be running 24 hours a day to predict, every day, which departments would need data and which data would they need. 
The purpose of this secondary program is to retrieve data from the source before the users need the data so the process is as efficient as possible. 

I hope you like this project :)
